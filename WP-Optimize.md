1. Open the ‘Images’ tab in the WP-Optimize Premium admin page and press the “Unused images and sizes” tab.
2. To scan your website for unused images, press the “Scan website for unused images” button. 
3. To delete these images, either individually select the images by clicking on the images to highlight them, or press the “Select all” button to delete all unused images.
4. Once you have selected all the unused images you want to delete from your site, scroll down and either choose “Move selected images to trash” or “Delete the selection permanently”. WP-Optimise will then delete all copies of the selected image file plus any record in the Media Library.
